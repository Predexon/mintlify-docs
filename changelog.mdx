#### Breaking Changes

<Warning>
**Candlesticks Response Structure Changed**

The `/v1/polymarket/candlesticks/{condition_id}` endpoint response structure has been updated:

**Before:** Nested array of `[candlestick_data_array, token_metadata]` tuples
**After:** Flat structure with `condition_id` at root and `candlesticks` as a direct array of candlestick objects

```json
// New response structure
{
  "condition_id": "0x1234...",
  "candlesticks": [
    {
      "end_period_ts": 1704070800,
      "price": { "open": 0.55, "high": 0.57, ... },
      "volume": 125000.50,
      "trades_count": 847
    }
  ]
}
```
</Warning>

#### Schema Updates

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **CandlestickData** | New properly typed schema replacing untyped tuple format |
| **CandlesticksResponse** | Added `condition_id` field, flattened candlesticks array |
| **PriceData** | New schema with explicit dollar-formatted string fields (`open_dollars`, `high_dollars`, `low_dollars`, `close_dollars`, `mean_dollars`, `previous_dollars`) |

#### Improvements

- All price values in candlesticks now include both numeric and dollar-formatted string representations
- Response schemas are now fully typed for better client SDK generation
- Improved API documentation with accurate response examples
