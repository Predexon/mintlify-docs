### February 4, 2026

#### API v2 Launch

We're introducing **API v2** — a major update with 14 new endpoints, improved pagination, and expanded analytics capabilities. v1 remains fully supported; switch between versions using the dropdown in the docs sidebar.

**Base path:** All v2 endpoints live under `/v2/` (e.g., `https://api.predexon.com/v2/polymarket/markets`).

##### WebSocket Updates

<Card title="WebSocket API" icon="bolt">
  Major improvements to the WebSocket API with new event types, refined plan tiers, and better connection management.
</Card>

**New: Fee refund events**

The trades channel (`orders`) now delivers two event types: `order_filled` and `fee_refund`. Fee refund events allow precise net fee calculations by tracking Polymarket's maker rebate program. Correlate refunds to trades via `order_hash`.

**Plan tiers restructured (Free/Pro/Desk → Free/Dev/Pro/Enterprise)**

| Limit | Free | Dev | Pro | Enterprise |
|-------|------|-----|-----|------------|
| WebSocket access | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Subscriptions per connection | — | 10 | 100 | Custom |
| Items per subscription | — | 10 | 500 | Custom |
| Total items | — | 100 | 50,000 | Custom |
| Wildcard | — | No | 2 per channel | Yes |
| Priority routing | — | No | No | Yes |

**Wildcard rules updated**
- Wildcard connections are now tracked **per-channel** (e.g. a wildcard on `orders` does not count against `activity`)
- A wildcard connection cannot mix wildcard and regular subscriptions on the same channel
- Pro plan allows **2 wildcard connections per channel**

**Filter restrictions by channel**
- `market_slugs` filter is now only available on the trades (`orders`) channel
- `users` filter is not available on the lifecycle channel
- All channels support `condition_ids` and wildcard `["*"]`

**New error code:** `RATE_LIMIT` — returned when a client is sending messages too fast

**Keepalive documentation:** Server pings every 30s, 60s pong timeout, 2-minute idle timeout for zero subscriptions, and buffer overflow protections (1 MB drop threshold, 4 MB disconnect)

##### Breaking Changes (v1 → v2)

<Warning>
These changes only affect v2 endpoints. v1 endpoints remain unchanged.
</Warning>

**Path parameter renamed:** `{wallet_address}` → `{wallet}`

All wallet-related endpoints now use `{wallet}` instead of `{wallet_address}`:
- `/v2/polymarket/wallet/pnl/{wallet}`
- `/v2/polymarket/wallet/positions/{wallet}`
- `/v2/dflow/wallet/pnl/{wallet}`
- `/v2/dflow/wallet/positions/{wallet}`

**Pagination: offset → cursor-based**

Several endpoints have switched from `offset` pagination to cursor-based `pagination_key` for better performance on large datasets:

| Endpoint | Removed | Added |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `/v2/polymarket/trades` | `offset` | `pagination_key` |
| `/v2/dflow/trades` | `offset` | `pagination_key` |
| `/v2/kalshi/markets` | `offset` | `pagination_key` |
| `/v2/kalshi/trades` | `offset` | `pagination_key` |

**Parameter renames:**

| Endpoint | v1 Param | v2 Param |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `/v2/polymarket/trades` | `user` | `wallet` |
| `/v2/polymarket/activity` | `user` | `wallet` |

**Removed parameters:**

| Endpoint | Removed Param | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| `/v2/polymarket/markets` | `token_id` | Use `condition_id` instead |
| `/v2/matching-markets/pairs` | `match_type` | All pairs are exact matches (similarity ≥ 95) |

---

##### New Filter Parameters

| Endpoint | New Parameters |
|----------|----------------|
| `/v2/polymarket/markets` | `min_volume_1d`, `min_volume_7d`, `min_volume_30d`, `min_trades_1d`, `min_trades_7d`, `min_trades_30d` |
| `/v2/polymarket/trades` | `min_total`, `wallet` |
| `/v2/polymarket/activity` | `sort_by`, `wallet` |

</Card>

#### Breaking Changes

<Warning>
**Candlesticks Response Structure Changed**

The `/v1/polymarket/candlesticks/{condition_id}` endpoint response structure has been updated:

**Before:** Nested array of `[candlestick_data_array, token_metadata]` tuples
**After:** Flat structure with `condition_id` at root and `candlesticks` as a direct array of candlestick objects

```json
// New response structure
{
  "condition_id": "0x1234...",
  "candlesticks": [
    {
      "end_period_ts": 1704070800,
      "price": { "open": 0.55, "high": 0.57, ... },
      "volume": 125000.50,
      "trades_count": 847
    }
  ]
}
```
</Warning>

#### Schema Updates

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **CandlestickData** | New properly typed schema replacing untyped tuple format |
| **CandlesticksResponse** | Added `condition_id` field, flattened candlesticks array |
| **PriceData** | New schema with explicit dollar-formatted string fields (`open_dollars`, `high_dollars`, `low_dollars`, `close_dollars`, `mean_dollars`, `previous_dollars`) |

#### Improvements

- All price values in candlesticks now include both numeric and dollar-formatted string representations
- Response schemas are now fully typed for better client SDK generation
- Improved API documentation with accurate response examples
