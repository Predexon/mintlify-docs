description: "Get P&L summary and realized P&L time series for a wallet"
---

Returns both a **summary** (realized, unrealized, fees) and a **time series** of cumulative realized P&L.

**Summary fields** (current snapshot):
- `realized_pnl` — Total realized P&L from sells and redemptions
- `unrealized_pnl` — Unrealized P&L computed live from open positions
- `total_pnl` — `realized_pnl + unrealized_pnl`
- `fees_paid` / `fees_refunded` — Taker fees paid and maker rebates received

**Time series** (`pnl_over_time`):
- Shows **realized P&L only** — does not include unrealized gains/losses
- Each data point is cumulative realized P&L at that timestamp

<Note>
Use `condition_id` query param to filter to a specific market. This correctly handles split/merge operations by aggregating both sides.
