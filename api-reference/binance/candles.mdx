---

Fetch OHLCV candlestick data derived from Binance book ticker mid-prices. Intervals `1s` and `1m` read from pre-aggregated materialized views. Larger intervals (`5m`, `15m`, `1h`, `4h`, `1d`) are aggregated on-the-fly from 1m candles.

Useful for backtesting crypto up/down prediction markets:
- `15m` for 15-minute markets
- `1h` for 1-hour markets
- `4h` and `1d` for longer timeframes
