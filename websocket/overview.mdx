## Quick Start

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://wss.predexon.com/v1/your_api_key');

ws.onopen = () => {
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    action: 'subscribe',
    platform: 'polymarket',
    version: 1,
    type: 'orders',
    filters: { users: ['0x1234...'] }
  }));
};

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const msg = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (msg.type === 'event') {
    console.log('Trade:', msg.data);
  }
};
```

## Connection

### Endpoint

```
wss://wss.predexon.com/v1/YOUR_API_KEY
```

On successful connection, the server sends:

```json
{
  "type": "connected",
  "message": "Connected to Predexon WebSocket"
}
```

### Connection Errors

| HTTP Status | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| 401 | Missing or invalid API key |
| 403 | Free tier — WebSocket access requires a paid plan |
| 429 | Connection limit exceeded for your plan |
| 503 | Server at capacity |

## Channels

| Channel | `type` value | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Trades | `"orders"` | Order fills and fee refunds |
| Activity | `"activity"` | Position splits, merges, and redemptions |
| Lifecycle | `"lifecycle"` | New market registration and condition resolution |

### Filter Availability by Channel

| Filter | Trades (`orders`) | Activity (`activity`) | Lifecycle (`lifecycle`) |
|--------|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| `users` | Yes | Yes | No |
| `condition_ids` | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `market_slugs` | Yes | No | No |
| Wildcard `["*"]` | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Plan Limits

| Limit | Dev | Pro |
|-------|-----|-----|
| Subscriptions per connection | 10 | 100 |
| Items per subscription | 10 | 500 |
| Total items across all subscriptions | 100 | 50,000 |
| Wildcard subscriptions | Not allowed | Allowed |
| Wildcard connections per API key | 0 | 2 per channel |

Subscription and item limits are global across all channels — not per-channel. Wildcard connections are tracked per-channel (e.g. a wildcard on `orders` does not count against your `activity` wildcard limit).

<Warning>
A wildcard connection cannot mix wildcard and regular subscriptions on the same channel.
</Warning>

## Keepalive & Connection Management

- The server sends a WebSocket **ping every 30 seconds**. Your client must respond with a pong (most WebSocket libraries handle this automatically).
- If no pong is received within **60 seconds**, the connection is closed.
- If a connection has **zero active subscriptions for 2 minutes**, it is closed with close code `4000`.
- If the client is consuming events too slowly and the server-side outbound buffer exceeds **1 MB**, new events will be dropped. If it exceeds **4 MB**, the connection is terminated.

## Error Handling

All errors follow this format:

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "message": "Human-readable error message"
}
```

### Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `AUTH_REQUIRED` | No API key provided |
| `AUTH_FAILED` | API key not found or invalid |
| `CONNECTION_LIMIT` | Server-wide connection cap reached |
| `WILDCARD_CONNECTION_LIMIT` | Wildcard connection limit for your key exceeded |
| `SUBSCRIPTION_LIMIT` | Maximum subscriptions reached |
| `ITEMS_PER_SUB_LIMIT` | Too many items in single subscription |
| `ITEMS_LIMIT` | Maximum total items reached |
| `WILDCARD_NOT_ALLOWED` | Your plan does not support wildcard subscriptions |
| `INVALID_FILTERS` | Missing or invalid filter, or filter not supported on this channel |
| `SUBSCRIPTION_NOT_FOUND` | Subscription ID doesn't exist |
| `PARSE_ERROR` | Invalid JSON message |
| `UNKNOWN_ACTION` | Unrecognized action field |
| `RATE_LIMIT` | Client is sending messages too fast |
