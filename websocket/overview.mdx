## Quick Start

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://wss.predexon.com/v1/your_api_key');

ws.onopen = () => {
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    action: 'subscribe',
    platform: 'polymarket',
    version: 1,
    type: 'orders',
    filters: { users: ['0x1234...'] }
  }));
};

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const msg = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (msg.type === 'event') {
    console.log('Trade:', msg.data);
  }
};
```

## Connection

### Endpoint

```
wss://wss.predexon.com/v1/<API_KEY>
```

Include your API key in the URL path. The server validates the key and returns your plan tier.

### Connection Response

On successful connection:

```json
{
  "type": "connected",
  "message": "Connected to Predexon WebSocket"
}
```

### Idle Timeout

Connections with no active subscriptions are closed after **120 seconds**. Subscribe to at least one filter to keep the connection alive.

## Plans & Limits

| Feature | Free | Pro |
|---------|------|-----|
| Subscriptions | 2 | 100 |
| Items per subscription | 5 | 500 |
| Total items | 10 | 50,000 |
| Wildcard (all trades) | No | Yes |

### Wildcard Subscription (Pro only)

Pro users can subscribe to **all trades** across the entire platform using the wildcard subscription. This is ideal for building comprehensive datasets, real-time analytics dashboards, or monitoring market-wide activity.

**Wildcard rules:**
- Wildcard must be the **only** subscription on the connection
- Wildcard allows only **one active connection** per API key
- Cannot add other subscriptions while wildcard is active

**Example wildcard subscription:**
```json
{
  "action": "subscribe",
  "platform": "polymarket",
  "version": 1,
  "type": "orders",
  "filters": {
    "users": ["*"]
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

All errors follow this format:

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "message": "Human-readable error message"
}
```
