## Quick Start

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://wss.predexon.com/v1/your_api_key');

ws.onopen = () => {
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    action: 'subscribe',
    platform: 'polymarket',
    version: 1,
    type: 'orders',
    filters: { users: ['0x1234...'] }
  }));
};

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const msg = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (msg.type === 'event') {
    console.log('Trade:', msg.data);
  }
};
```

## Connection

### Endpoint

```
wss://wss.predexon.com/v1/<API_KEY>
```

API key in the URL path. On connect the server sends:

```json
{
  "type": "connected",
  "message": "Connected to Predexon WebSocket"
}
```

### Idle Timeout

Connections with no active subscriptions are closed after **120 seconds**. Subscribe to at least one filter to keep the connection alive.

## Channels

| Channel | `type` value | Events |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Trades | `"orders"` | Order fills (BUY/SELL) |
| Activity | `"activity"` | Splits, merges, redemptions |
| Lifecycle | `"lifecycle"` | Token registrations, condition resolutions |

## Plans & Limits

| Feature | Free | Pro | Desk |
|---------|------|-----|------|
| Subscriptions | 2 | 100 | 1,000 |
| Items per subscription | 5 | 500 | 500 |
| Total items | 10 | 50,000 | 500,000 |
| Wildcard | No | Yes (exclusive) | Yes (can mix) |
| Wildcard connections | 0 | 1 | 10 |

### Wildcard Subscriptions

Pro and Desk users can subscribe to **all events** across the platform using the wildcard filter `{"users": ["*"]}`.

**Pro rules:**
- Wildcard must be the **only** subscription on the connection (exclusive)
- Only **1 wildcard connection** per API key

**Desk rules:**
- Wildcard can be **mixed** with other subscriptions on the same connection
- Up to **10 wildcard connections** per API key

**Example wildcard subscription:**
```json
{
  "action": "subscribe",
  "platform": "polymarket",
  "version": 1,
  "type": "orders",
  "filters": {
    "users": ["*"]
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

All errors follow this format:

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "message": "Human-readable error message"
}
```

### Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `AUTH_REQUIRED` | No API key provided |
| `AUTH_FAILED` | API key not found or invalid |
| `INVALID_FILTERS` | Missing or malformed filters |
| `SUBSCRIPTION_LIMIT` | Maximum subscriptions reached |

| `SUBSCRIPTION_NOT_FOUND` | Subscription ID doesn't exist |
| `PARSE_ERROR` | Invalid JSON message |
| `UNKNOWN_ACTION` | Unrecognized action field |
