description: "Find equivalent markets across Polymarket and Kalshi"

## Overview

Predexon's market matching API helps you discover equivalent or related markets across different prediction market platforms. This is invaluable for:

- **Arbitrage detection**: Find price discrepancies for the same event
- **Portfolio diversification**: Spread risk across platforms
- **Research**: Compare market efficiency across platforms
- **Liquidity analysis**: Find the best platform for a given market

## How Matching Works

Our matching algorithm uses a knowledge graph built from:
- Event metadata and descriptions
- Resolution criteria
- Time constraints
- Semantic similarity

### Match Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Exact** | Same underlying event with identical resolution criteria |
| **Related** | Similar events or correlated outcomes |

## Finding Matches

### From Polymarket to Kalshi

```python
import requests

BASE_URL = "https://api.predexon.com"

response = requests.get(
    f"{BASE_URL}/v1/matching-markets",
    params={"polymarket_market_slug": "will-donald-trump-win-the-2024-us-presidential-election"}
)

data = response.json()

print(f"Query: {data['query']['title']}")
print(f"Total matches: {data['summary']['total_matches']}")

for match in data['matches']['KALSHI']['exact']:
    print(f"  Exact: {match['title']}")
    print(f"    Ticker: {match['market_ticker']}")

for match in data['matches']['KALSHI']['related']:
    print(f"  Related: {match['title']}")
```

### From Kalshi to Polymarket

```python
response = requests.get(
    f"{BASE_URL}/v1/matching-markets",
    params={"kalshi_market_ticker": "PRES-2024-DJT"}
)

data = response.json()

for match in data['matches']['POLYMARKET']['exact']:
    print(f"  {match['title']}")
    print(f"    Slug: {match['market_slug']}")
```

## Response Structure

```json
{
  "query": {
    "platform": "POLYMARKET",
    "market_slug": "will-donald-trump-win-the-2024-us-presidential-election",
    "title": "Will Donald Trump win the 2024 Presidential Election?",
    "status": "open"
  },
  "matches": {
    "KALSHI": {
      "exact": [
        {
          "market_ticker": "PRES-2024-DJT",
          "title": "Will Trump win the 2024 presidential election?",
          "yes_subtitle": "Donald Trump wins",
          "status": "open",
          "explanation": "Same underlying event with identical resolution criteria"
        }
      ],
      "related": [
        {
          "market_ticker": "PRES-2024-REP",
          "title": "Will a Republican win the 2024 presidential election?",
          "status": "open",
          "explanation": "Correlated outcome - Republican win includes Trump"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "summary": {
    "total_matches": 5,
    "exact_matches": 1,
    "related_matches": 4,
    "platforms": ["KALSHI"]
  }
}
```

## Batch Matching

For efficiency, query multiple markets at once:

```python
response = requests.get(
    f"{BASE_URL}/v1/matching-markets/batch",
    params={
        "polymarket_market_slugs": [
            "will-donald-trump-win-the-2024-us-presidential-election",
            "will-fed-cut-rates-january",
            "will-btc-hit-100k"
        ]
    }
)

data = response.json()

for slug, result in data['markets'].items():
    print(f"\n{slug}:")
    print(f"  Matches: {result['summary']['total_matches']}")
```

## Arbitrage Detection Example

```python
def find_arbitrage_opportunities():
    """Find markets with significant price differences across platforms."""

    # Get top Polymarket markets
    pm_response = requests.get(
        f"{BASE_URL}/v1/polymarket/markets",
        params={"status": "open", "sort": "volume", "limit": 50}
    )

    opportunities = []

    for market in pm_response.json()["markets"]:
        # Find Kalshi matches
        match_response = requests.get(
            f"{BASE_URL}/v1/matching-markets",
            params={"polymarket_market_slug": market["market_slug"]}
        )

        matches = match_response.json()

        if matches["summary"]["exact_matches"] > 0:
            pm_price = market["outcomes"][0]["price"]  # Yes price

            # Compare with Kalshi prices (would need Kalshi price API)
            for kalshi_match in matches["matches"]["KALSHI"]["exact"]:
                # Calculate price difference
                # Note: You'd need to fetch Kalshi prices separately
                opportunities.append({
                    "polymarket_slug": market["market_slug"],
                    "polymarket_price": pm_price,
                    "kalshi_ticker": kalshi_match["market_ticker"],
                    "title": market["title"]
                })

    return opportunities
```

## Use Cases

### Portfolio Hedging

```python
def find_hedging_options(polymarket_slug: str):
    """Find related markets that could hedge a position."""

    response = requests.get(
        f"{BASE_URL}/v1/matching-markets",
        params={"polymarket_market_slug": polymarket_slug}
    )

    matches = response.json()

    # Related matches might offer hedging opportunities
    hedges = []
    for match in matches["matches"]["KALSHI"]["related"]:
        hedges.append({
            "ticker": match["market_ticker"],
            "title": match["title"],
            "explanation": match.get("explanation", "")
        })

    return hedges
```

### Market Coverage Analysis

```python
def analyze_market_coverage(category: str):
    """Analyze which markets exist on both platforms."""

    # Get Polymarket markets in category
    pm_response = requests.get(
        f"{BASE_URL}/v1/polymarket/markets",
        params={"status": "open", "tags": [category], "limit": 100}
    )

    coverage = {
        "polymarket_only": 0,
        "both_platforms": 0,
        "markets": []
    }

    for market in pm_response.json()["markets"]:
        match_response = requests.get(
            f"{BASE_URL}/v1/matching-markets",
            params={"polymarket_market_slug": market["market_slug"]}
        )

        if match_response.json()["summary"]["exact_matches"] > 0:
            coverage["both_platforms"] += 1
        else:
            coverage["polymarket_only"] += 1

    return coverage
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use batch endpoints for multiple lookups">
    Instead of making individual requests for each market, use the batch endpoint to reduce latency and API calls.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cache match results">
    Market matches don't change frequently. Cache results for at least 1 hour to reduce API usage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Handle missing matches gracefully">
    Not all markets have cross-platform equivalents. Your code should handle empty match results.
  </Accordion>
