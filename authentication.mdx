description: "How to authenticate with the Predexon API"
---

## Current Access

The Predexon API is currently in **public beta** and does not require authentication for most endpoints. You can start making requests immediately.

```bash
curl "https://predexon-data-service-8970529761.us-central1.run.app/v1/polymarket/markets?limit=10"
```

## Rate Limiting

Without authentication, requests are rate-limited based on IP address:

- **60 requests per minute**
- **10,000 requests per day**

<Warning>
Exceeding rate limits will result in `429 Too Many Requests` responses. Implement exponential backoff in your applications.
</Warning>

## API Keys (Coming Soon)

API key authentication will be available soon for:

- Higher rate limits
- Usage analytics
- Priority support
- Access to premium endpoints

## Best Practices

### Caching

Many endpoints return data that doesn't change frequently. Implement caching to reduce API calls:

```python
import requests
from functools import lru_cache
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@lru_cache(maxsize=100)
def get_market(condition_id: str) -> dict:
    """Cache market metadata for 5 minutes."""
    response = requests.get(
        f"{BASE_URL}/v1/polymarket/markets",
        params={"condition_id": condition_id}
    )
    return response.json()
```

### Retry Logic

Implement retries with exponential backoff for transient errors:

```python
import time
import requests
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
from urllib3.util.retry import Retry

session = requests.Session()
retries = Retry(
    total=3,
    backoff_factor=0.5,
    status_forcelist=[500, 502, 503, 504]
)
session.mount("https://", HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retries))
```

### Connection Pooling

Reuse connections for better performance:

```python
# Create a session once
session = requests.Session()

# Use it for all requests
response = session.get(f"{BASE_URL}/v1/polymarket/markets")
```

## CORS

The API supports CORS for browser-based applications. All origins are currently allowed during the beta period.

```javascript
// This works from any domain
fetch("https://predexon-data-service-8970529761.us-central1.run.app/v1/polymarket/markets")
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

## Health Check

Use the health endpoint to verify API availability:

```bash
curl "https://predexon-data-service-8970529761.us-central1.run.app/health"
# Returns: {"status": "healthy"}
```
