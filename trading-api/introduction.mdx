## Overview

Predexon Trading API provides a unified interface for trading on prediction markets across multiple venues. Users don't manage their own wallets - the API handles wallet creation, key management, and transaction signing on their behalf.

## Base URL

```
https://trade.predexon.com
```

## Supported Venues

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Polymarket" icon="chart-line">
    Polygon blockchain. Supports limit and market orders on the orderbook.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Kalshi" icon="bolt">
    Solana blockchain with atomic swaps. Instant execution with no persistent orderbook.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

| Venue | Blockchain | Order Execution |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| `polymarket` | Polygon | Orderbook (limit/market orders) |
| `kalshi` | Solana | Atomic swaps |

## Authentication

All requests require an API key passed via the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://trade.predexon.com/api/users/create
```

### Ownership Model

- Each API key can create multiple users
- Users are "owned" by the API key that created them
- API keys can only access their own users (403 Forbidden otherwise)

</Accordion>

**Affected Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/users/create` (creates both Polymarket and Kalshi wallets)
- Any endpoint with `venue=kalshi`

## Polymarket vs Kalshi

| Feature | Polymarket | Kalshi |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Blockchain | Polygon | Solana |
| Order Types | Limit & Market | Atomic swaps |
| Market Identifier | `tokenId` | `ticker` + `outcome` |
| Gas Fees | Gasless relay | User pays SOL |
| Cancel Orders | Yes | No (atomic execution) |

<Note>
Get Polymarket `tokenId` from the [List Markets](/api-reference/markets/list-markets) endpoint - each outcome has a unique ID in the `outcomes` array. For Kalshi, use the market `ticker` from [Kalshi List Markets](/api-reference/kalshi/list-markets) with `outcome` set to `"Yes"` or `"No"`.
</Note>
