## Overview

The Predexon Custodial Trading API provides a unified interface for trading on prediction markets across multiple venues. Users don't manage their own wallets - the API handles wallet creation, key management, and transaction signing on their behalf.

## Authentication

All requests require an API key passed via the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://trade.predexon.com/api/users/create
```

### Ownership Model

- Each API key can create multiple users
- Users are "owned" by the API key that created them
- API keys can only access their own users (403 Forbidden otherwise)
