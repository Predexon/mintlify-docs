<Warning>
Kalshi trading requires **USDC on Solana** and **SOL** in your wallet. SOL is needed for Solana transaction fees. See [Deposits](/trading-api/funds/deposit-info) for funding instructions.
</Warning>

## Constraints

| Constraint | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Min order | > 1 USDC |
| Outcome values | `Yes` or `No` (case-sensitive) |
| Amount precision | 2 decimal places |

## Amount Semantics

| Side | Amount Represents |
|------|-------------------|
| `buy` | USDC to spend |
| `sell` | Shares to sell |

<Note>
Kalshi orders execute atomically - they either fill completely or fail. There's no partial fill or orderbook. The `price` in the response is the execution price.
</Note>

<Note>
Get the `ticker` from [Kalshi List Markets](/api-reference/kalshi/list-markets).
