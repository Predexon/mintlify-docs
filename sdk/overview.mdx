</Info>

The Predexon Trade SDK is a **noncustodial** TypeScript SDK for trading on prediction markets. All signing happens locally—private keys never leave your environment.

## Architecture

The SDK provides a **single unified client** for two venues:
- **Polymarket (Polygon)** via Polymarket CLOB
- **Kalshi (Solana)** via DFlow swap flow

The SDK handles signing locally and coordinates with Predexon APIs for required venue workflows.

## Supported Venues

| Venue | Blockchain | Order Types | Status |
|-------|------------|-------------|--------|
| Polymarket | Polygon | Market, Limit | Full support |
| Kalshi | Solana | Market only | Full support |
