---

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I set a custom API base URL?">
    The SDK hard-locks to `https://trade.predexon.com` to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. A compromised or malicious base URL could steal your API key or serve malicious transactions for signing.

    This is an intentional security measure and cannot be overridden.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does Kalshi only support market orders?">
    Kalshi's DFlow infrastructure currently only supports market (Fill-And-Kill) orders. Limit order support may be added in the future.

    For now, use Polymarket if you need limit order functionality.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I handle wallet connection in a browser?">
    Use the appropriate adapter for your wallet provider:

    ```typescript
    // For wagmi/viem
    const walletClient = await getWalletClient();
    const wallet = createEvmAdapter(walletClient);

    // For Privy
    const wallet = createPrivyAdapter(privyEmbeddedWallet);
    ```

    See the [Wallet Adapters](/sdk/wallet-adapters) page for more details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use the SDK without a wallet?">
    Some read operations don't require a wallet:

    ```typescript
    const sdk = new PredexonSDK({ apiKey: 'your-key' });

    // These work without a wallet
    const positions = await sdk.getPositions({
      core: { venue: 'polymarket', wallet: address },
    });
    const balance = await sdk.getBalance({
      core: { venue: 'polymarket', wallet: address },
    });
    const orders = await sdk.getOpenOrders({
      core: { venue: 'polymarket', wallet: address },
    });
    ```

    However, placing orders, enabling trading, and redemption require a wallet to be configured.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do idempotency keys work?">
    Idempotency keys ensure that retrying a failed request doesn't create duplicate orders. The SDK auto-generates cryptographically secure keys by default.

    You can also provide your own:

    ```typescript
    // Auto-generated (recommended for most cases)
    await sdk.placeOrder({
      core: { venue: 'polymarket', wallet: '0x...', side: 'buy', amount: '10', type: 'market' },
      flags: { tokenId: '12345...' },
    });

    // Custom key (useful for retry logic)
    await sdk.placeOrder({
      core: { venue: 'polymarket', wallet: '0x...', side: 'buy', amount: '10', type: 'market' },
      flags: { tokenId: '12345...' },
      idempotencyKey: 'user-123-order-1234567890',
    });
    ```

    See the [Idempotency](/sdk/idempotency) page for more details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What blockchains does the SDK support?">
    | Venue | Blockchain |
    |-------|------------|
    | Polymarket | Polygon (EVM) |
    | Kalshi | Solana |

    For Polymarket, you need an EVM wallet (ethers.js, viem, wagmi, etc.).
    For Kalshi, you need Solana signing capabilities.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I handle signing errors?">
    Signing errors occur when the wallet fails to sign a transaction. Common causes:

    - User rejected the signature request
    - Wallet is disconnected
    - Hardware wallet timeout

    ```typescript
    import { SigningError } from '@predexon/trade-sdk';

    try {
      await sdk.placeOrder({
        core: { venue: 'polymarket', wallet: '0x...', side: 'buy', amount: '10', type: 'market' },
        flags: { tokenId: '12345...' },
      });
    } catch (error) {
      if (error instanceof SigningError) {
        // Prompt user to try again or reconnect wallet
        console.log('Please approve the transaction in your wallet');
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between amount and size?">
    - **amount**: USDC value (how much money to spend)
    - **size**: Number of shares/tokens

    For market BUY orders on Polymarket, you can specify either:
    - `amount: '100'` - Spend $100 USDC (buy however many shares that gets you)
    - `size: '50'` - Buy exactly 50 shares (spend whatever USDC that costs)

    For SELL orders and limit orders, always use `size`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get a Predexon API key?">
    Visit the [Predexon Dashboard](https://dashboard.predexon.com) to create an account and generate an API key.

    Store your API key securely in environment variables:

    ```typescript
    const sdk = new PredexonSDK({
      apiKey: process.env.PREDEXON_API_KEY!,
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is the SDK open source?">
    The SDK package is published on npm as `@predexon/trade-sdk`. Contact Predexon for source code access or contribution guidelines.
