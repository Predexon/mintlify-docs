## Architecture

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Local-First Signing" icon="key">
    Private keys never leave your environment. All order signing happens locally.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hard-Locked Endpoint" icon="lock">
    The SDK only communicates with `https://trade.predexon.com`. This cannot be overridden.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The SDK hard-locks to `https://trade.predexon.com` to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. A compromised base URL could steal your API key or serve malicious transactions for signing. HTTP redirects are rejected to prevent API key leakage.

## Response Validation

The SDK validates server responses before signing to ensure you're not signing malicious data.

### Polymarket

- **CLOB auth typed data**: Domain name, version, and chainId must match expected values
- **Redemption transactions**: Only whitelisted contract addresses allowed; transactions built locally from server-provided conditionId
- **Approval transactions**: Chain ID must be Polygon (137), targets restricted to approved USDC and CTF contracts

### Kalshi

- **Echo validation**: Server response must echo back your original ticker, outcome, side, and amount
- **Signer validation**: Your wallet must be a required signer; no unexpected signers allowed
- **Fee payer validation**: Must be your wallet or a known sponsor address
